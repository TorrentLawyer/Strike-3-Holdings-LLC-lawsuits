How to organize the Strike 3 Holdings LLC articles and blogs as they evolve their lawsuit filings.

The <a href="https://www.cashmanlawfirm.com/facts/strike-3-holdings/">Strike 3 Holdings LLC lawsuits</a> started off as <a href="https://www.torrentlawyer.com/strike-3-holdings-malibu-media-similarities/">copycats of the Malibu Media LLC lawsuits</a>, so they were initially really easy to write about.  But then they evolved into their own copyright troll animal with their own structure of filing copyright infringement lawsuits.

The Strike 3 Holdings LLC lawsuits were original simple copyright infringement lawsuits with a "copyright troll" twist -- use the enforcement powers of the federal courts and the threat of a $150,000 judgement against an accused "John Doe" defendant to convince each accused defendant to pay a large settlement in return for a release of liability from that lawsuit.

"Forum Shopping" -- We originally were discussing the choice of forums where Strike 3 Holdings LLC filed their lawsuits based on which federal court jurisdictions were friendly to their copyright troll styled lawsuits, and which were not.  Now they are choosing where to sue <a href="https://www.cashmanlawfirm.com/06-2023-strike-3-holdings-ohio-cases-by-month/#definition-of-forum-shopping">based on which type of defendant would be most willing to pay them a settlement</a>.

"Evolution of Laws" -- We discussed the various rulings of various federal court judges across the US to help our clients understand the risks involved in being sued in one jurisdiction versus another.  For example, being sued in the California Northern District Court was a more serious issue than being sued in the Texas Southern District Court (which at the time was less friendly to copyright trolls).  

"Splits Within a Federal District" -- But then, federal court judges started to differ in how they handled each of Strike 3 Holdings LLC's cases.  Some allowed them to proceed, others would not allow them to send subpoenas to the ISPs (to reveal the real identities of the accused defendants).  It became difficult to analyze the risk of being sued in New York (which had a split) versus DC (which also had a split), and other jurisdictions.  So it became a judge-by-judge analysis.

"Judge by Judge" analysis -- This was a tough one because as an attorney, we are servants of the court.  Criticizing judges for bias or hypocracy, or for taking a case when they had a conflict of interest was a sticky tight rope to walk.  Eventually, we found that we were tempering our words and this analysis ended up being difficult to do.  This became even more problematic when we represented a client where the judge knew about us and read our articles criticizing their decisions.  So while we stopped reporting on individual judges publicly, we continued to track them privately.

"Copyright Troll Attorney" analysis -- We then observed that copyright troll attorneys usually acted the same way with each of their lawsuits.  They had patterns on what they did in the courtroom, and they followed the same playbook for each defendant based on whether they were willing to name and serve a defendant or not.  Their skill set also became relevant because it was helpful to know whether they were bluffing to the court and to our clients or not.  Some attorneys (Jackie James, see https://www.torrentlawyer.com/strike-3-holdings-attorneys/) would follow through on their threats, while others (too many to list) followed scripts provided to them by their clients.

This approach has been helpful even today, but stating an attoney's name and their proclivities are not useful to the reader because those attorneys also read our website and changed their approaches.

Today, the website focuses on the day-to-day copyright infringement filings and trends on what to do (or what NOT to do) to become a target of their lawsuits.  We discuss technology trends (Google Adwords tracking), and we discuss trends on where the lawsuits are filed.  Our front page of the website simply categorized the kinds of lawsuits a reader would find himself involved in (e.g., copyright infringement lawsuits, software piracy lawsuits, etc.) and provides them a walkthrough based on whether you have received an ISP subpoena notification letter letting you know that you have been sued (https://www.cashmanlawfirm.com/isp-subpoena-notification-letter/) or whether you have already been named and served as a defendant (https://www.cashmanlawfirm.com/named-and-served/).

I like this approach, but the downside is that the front page of the website hides the hundreds of articles and blog entries we have written on so many topics over the years.  In other words, our websites as they are today hides 99% of the content which is hidden inside the websites, and we rely on search engines to direct readers to particular articles hidden within our websites.

The problem with this is the search engines are not consistent, and we often get banned from a particular website because of the content we discuss on our websites.  Our websites are piracy friendly (our clients are defendants of piracy cases), and they discuss bittorrent subjects.  The fact that our lawsuit has the word "Torrent" in the domain name and that we discuss specific movie titles which have been pirated has gotten us banned multiple times from the search engines.

For example, our 200+ articles on the TorrentLawyer.com website were excluded from the Bing search engines for over a year (this has recently changed, and our articles are showing up again).  This mean that we were no longer showing up on DuckDuckGo, or any of the other piracy-focused search engines we use each day.  Google continued to list our articles, but having thousands of good quality articles written over the years censored and banned was simply frustrating.

For these reasons, I am turning to you -- the reader -- to help me figure out how to best share our articles and our content.
